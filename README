DESCRIPTION

    This S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly mod gives the player a more progressive approach to Ironman playthrough by allowing certain 
    aspects of a prior playthrough to be tracked and restored on successive playthroughs.  The system currently has 
    the following features...

FEATURES
    - 100% Customizable Roguelike experience through MCM (or config parameters in the code if you prefer)
    - 100% (as far as I know) conflict free from other mods.  Jabbers' Ironman Roguelike does not overwrite 
      any scripts or ltx files and because of this it should not interfere with any other mods.   If it does
      please let me know so I can resolve.
    - Restore player created stashes and items within between Ironman playthroughs
        - Player stashes are be marked on your PDA map just stash locations from missions
        - Item condition degredation applied to each applicable item between Ironman playthroughs
    - Restore trader rep with optional penalty loss between Ironman playthroughs
        - Trader rep will never go below the value a trader receives at the start of a new game
    - Restore character rep with optional penalty loss between Ironman playthroughs
        - Character rep will never go below the value the character receives at the start of a new game
    - All Stashes/Items/Rep are saved based on faction so that seperate Ironman playthroughs of each faction
      do not interfere with each other.  IE: Stashes created on a Loner playthrough will not be seen on a 
      Military playthrough and vice versa.
    - Ability for other mods to save data to be used in concurent playthroughs via scripting callbacks
        - RegisterScriptCallback("on_roguelike_load_state", on_roguelike_load_state)
            -- on_roguelike_load_state(data) --<table> access to all prior Ironman session saved data
        - RegisterScriptCallback("on_roguelike_save_state", on_roguelike_save_state)
            -- on_roguelike_load_state(data) --<table> store data that you want to read at the start of Ironman session

INSTALLATION
    Simply extract into your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly installation folder.

FAQ
    Q: Doesn't this already exist with the Azazel game mode? 
    A: Not really, while Azazel does allows you to continue as a new stalker after dieing, it's missing the "start over" 
      aspect that Ironman provides.  In roguelike games, when you die, you are dead and you need to start over.  This is what
      Ironman is about.  That said, usually roguelike games also give you some sort of progression to make successive playthroughs 
      a bit easier, usually through something like achievements, skills, items, etc.  This is what I hope to capture with this mod.
    Q: How do I reset an Ironman playthrough so the stashes/rep/etc are not restored on my next playthrough
    A: Simply delete the file in appdata pertaining to the faction you want to start over with.  Ex: appdata/roguelike_actor_bandit.state
    Q: I have an idea for progression that isnt included in this mod, how do I contact you.
    A: Well, the easiest way would be discord.  You can join my personal discord (https://discord.gg/HRyCGesuXq) and message me direct.
       I can also be found live most days on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/jabbers_) so feel free to stop by and say Hi! 
       Additionally you can leave me a message on moddb... although this isnt my preferred communication platform so my response may be 
       slower.   
TODO
    - Implement some sort of Achievement based character progression system.  Example: Finishing the questline "Living Ledgend" might 
      give the player a permanent bonus to carry weight.  This bonus would be applied on all successive Ironman playthroughs.
